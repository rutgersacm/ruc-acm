  <p>The Rutgers University Camden ACM Chapter aims to foster a community through technology and science. We believe that technology is a supreme benefit to society, and through its use we can better ourselves and the lives of those around us. We hold bi-weekly meetings in Armitage 121 to talk about tech-related events, projects, and opportunities both on and off campus.</p>
